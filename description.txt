Hello, all! I'm Yuyutsu, and I'd like to introduce you to the Spirit Mod, one of Terraria's largest content mods. I've been developing the Spirit Mod for more than 5 years alongside a wonderfully talented team, and we've added multiple bosses, biomes, weapon sets, events, and mechanics in that time! My ultimate goal is to create a fresh, immersive Terraria experience with endless possibilities for you all to explore. We hope you enjoy the mod!
